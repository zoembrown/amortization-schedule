# amortization-schedule

This is my final project for CIT 243: C# II, I took this class in Spring of 2023 at Maysville Community and Technical College.

The assignment was to complete a large final project of the student's choice that would showcase our programming skills to potential employers and to write the documentation for it. My project is an amortization schedule calculator which allows the uers to input information about a loan, stores that information in a database, and generates amortization schedules for selected loans. The documentation I wrote for the program is in the file titled "Amortization Schedule App.pdf".

There are a few features I would like to add (e.g. the ability to delete or edit the information about a loan after it has been added to the database and the ability to delete or edit information about a payment after it has been added) but overall I am very proud of what I managed to complete in half a semester.
